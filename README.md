Descriptions of overall project, and a few code samples of my respective contributions to my senior design project in collaboration with NUWC.

Maritime Vessel Movement Analysis is a desktop-based, java/javascript application. It is designed to take in AIS vessel messages in real time, parse them, display them on screen in real time, and allow for the storage and referencing of key data regarding each one. It was assigned to us by the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth in collaboration with NUWC, the overall process of development spanned from around October of 2016 to May of 2017.

My main contributions in terms of front end were the UI buildingformatting, styling, and event handling. This includes the javascript end, in regards to making sure each filtered ship type had corresponding identification. 

The UI is built in javaFX and styled in CSS.

My technical contributions spanned most of the 20 or so classes we ended up having for the project, however one of my main responsibilities was ensuring our database was fed properly, the information was easy and fast to aquire from our GUI search systems, and we could also reference it for such things as displaying paths in real time. A lot of the information from AIS messages is unreadable to those not educated in the data format, so extensive work was also required in writing methos for translation. 

All database interactions were written using the JDBC library in Java for executing queries and obtaining/storing information.

With respect to my two other team members contributions, I have not uploaded the entirety of the project. However, pictures representing an overview of the system, including examples of the database systems have been included for the viewer's interest.

The process of creating this project was an interesting one, we had a client at NUWC who outlined our requirements and spoke to us regularly in regards to the direction of the project. We delivered a final build with all documentation on May 7th and held a presentation in front of 100-150 or so people.

This project took hundreds of hours of work, a lot of it went into planning, documentation, and sprints. We used Gitlab for version control to manage everyone's individual contributions and any merging conflicts. I consider the experience of this project to be very valuable in terms of learning how an industry project may go, as well as the planning and tools needed to make such a process go smoothly.
